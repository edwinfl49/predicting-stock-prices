# Predicting Stock Prices
In this project, we work through the workflow necessary to train a linear regression model. The dataset used is historical data from the S&P500 Index that includes daily data for this index since about 1950. The model will predict the index prices based on historical data.

## Project Goals
- Import and preprocess the data
- Work with time-series data
- Use historical data to create new data
- Learn how to use window/rolling functions in Pandas
- Train and fit a linear regression model
- Evaluate model performance

## Disclaimer
Do not make trades with any of the models developed in this project. The person writing this code has virtually no experience in the financial industry, and nothing in this project contains stock trading advice. 

This project was adapted and expanded from the Dataquest.io curriculum.
